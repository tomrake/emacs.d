* The emacs.d of Tom Rake
** Philosophy
- Avoid chapter 11 Bankruptcy
  - Reorganize
  - Document
  - Regular cruft needs to be cut.

** Rough Design description
- init.el is written from Emacs.org on save. Or M-x org-babel-tangle when init.el get hung up.
- the scripts/ directory is intended to hold code to paper over OS variation.
  - The msys2 subsystem supplied many of the GNU tools on Windors that emacs uses on 'nix platorms.
- In a computer/user cases the scripts/ will likely need to be initialized with base-directories.
