* The emacs.d of Tom Rake
** Philosophy
- Avoid chapter 11 Bankruptcy
  - Reorganize
  - Document
  - Regular cruft needs to be cut.

** Rough Design description
- init.el is written from Emacs.org on save. Or M-x org-babel-tangle when init.el get hung up.
- the scripts/ directory is intended to hold code to paper over OS variation.
  - The msys2 subsystem supplied many of the GNU tools on Windors that emacs uses on 'nix platorms.
- In a computer/user cases the scripts/ will likely need to be initialized with base-directories.

*** Pressing
[2024-04-28]
- I want to add code hacking elements to a new laptop MMIV for travel.
- I think it is time to merge testing changes back into main for production on DESKER.

  - msys2 use cases
- Note Publishing - org-publish
  - Creating a body of knowledge based on small notes
- Recievership
  - All tasks need to be balanced
  - cruft and experimental code that crept in main need to be cut.
