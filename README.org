** Thanks
- David Wilson at systemcrafters.net

** My emacs requirements
- several computers
- sereral accounts
- common function and setup.
  
** The emacs init cluster design
**** Chemacs2
- [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2][Chemacs]] is used to have separate emacs configuration. The ~/.emacs-profiles.el defines various chemacs profiles.
  - ~/.emacs.d is from chemcs2 so starting emacs using the --with-profile options will start emacs with the local-configuration.
**** local-configuration selection
- The chemacs-profile-name, system-name and  user-loging-name are combined to generate an unique local-configuration.
- Emacs.org/init.el contains core functions and functions to be initialized by a local-configuration.
**** clustering of configurations
- All the unique local-configurations are stored in the cluster repo.
