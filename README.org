* The emacs.d of Tom Rake
** Philosophy
- Avoid chapter 11 Bankruptcy
  - Code for reuse
  - Simple Configuration on per computer/user basis
  - Reorganize
  - Document
  - Regular cruft needs to be cut.

** Rough Design description
- init.el is written from Emacs.org on save. Or M-x org-babel-tangle when init.el get hung up.
- the scripts/ directory is intended to hold code to paper over OS variation.
  - The msys2 subsystem supplied many of the GNU tools on Windors that emacs uses on 'nix platorms.
- In a computer/user cases the scripts/ will likely need to be initialized with base-directories.
  - This is the basis of cluster membership.

** Latest  work
To facilitate emacs.d configuration reuse across several computers I reply on chemacs2 and a cluster member for each computer/user combo.

- Added a multi-init-cluster organization
  - Detailed configuration is on a computer-user-symbol basis.
  - All cluster member config from the same repo.
  - Each computer-user-symbol case is carried by all cluster members.

- Emacs.org -> init.el
  - Is designed carefull for my reuse cases.
  - Each use case defines configuration requirment of Emacs.org
  - init.el is produced by tangling Emacs.org
